                  <h2>Ciao! I'm Emmanuel Barbosa!</h2>
                  <p>I am a programmer, chess player, a musician, and currently a student. My dream is to become a skilled-programmer as well as a Marine.
                      Ever since I was a kid, I always love mind games like: solving puzzles, riddles, chess, learning new languages, and any other games or hobbies that requires thinking.
                      On that account, my mind became sharpened and I learned to think critically and logically at a young age. Not only my mind, I also include in my daily life are those physical activities.
                      such as: Exercising, Running, and Swimming.</p>
